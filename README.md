## Git Playground
This is a collection of test files for people to use to play around with git in a language/framework-agnostic environment.  It is a work in progress, but check out the "instructions" branch for what I've got so far.  My intent is to create a tool for people to learn git.  I made a [walkthrough](https://github.com/esoergel/meta/wiki/Git-Walkthrough) for my coderaising group that was well received, so I decided to make this as a more general, language-agnostic learning tool.

### Skills to learn:

#### Basic
add, commit, branch, checkout, merge

#### Collaborative
remote, clone, push, pull, pull-request
